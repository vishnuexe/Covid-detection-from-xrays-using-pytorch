# Covid-detection-from-xrays-using-pytorch

A ResNet-18 model is used to train it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. The dataset used has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. The objective of this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy. Please note that this dataset, and the model that I train in the project, can not be used to diagnose COVID-19 or Viral Pneumonia. I am only using this data for educational purpose.
